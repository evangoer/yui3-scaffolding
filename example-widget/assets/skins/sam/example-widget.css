/* CORE STYLES + 'SAM' SKIN STYLES
 * 
 * If you set skinnable: true for a module, YUI tries to load a file 
 * using the path: {base}/{module}/assets/skins/sam/{module}.css. 
 *
 * In production-quality YUI code, the YUI Builder would automatically 
 * generate this file for you from other CSS files in your src tree: 
 * 'example-widget-core.css' and 'example-widget-skin.css'. 
 * Instead, we're skipping YUI Builder (for now) and just adding CSS 
 * directly to the file that YUI Builder would have built for us. 
 * 
 * Another option is to ignore YUI conventions around skins and just 
 * load CSS as a YUI module (type: 'css'). Then you can lay out your 
 * CSS assets however you like.
